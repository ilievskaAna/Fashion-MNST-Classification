This project implements a computer vision pipeline to classify Fashion-MNIST images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It includes data preprocessing (reshaping, normalization), data augmentation (rotation, shifts, zoom, horizontal flip), and model building with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers. The model is trained with the Adam optimizer and evaluated using test accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix, while visualizations show predicted versus true labels and class probabilities.
